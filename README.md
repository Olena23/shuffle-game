# shuffle-game
A guessing game where you have to guess two similar cards. Star raiting, your time and number of mover are recorded.
A timer starts as soon as you load the game. So don't linger and start clicking!
However, beware to click more than two cards untill you get the move result - you will be punished and even if you've guessed two out of three, your move will be spoled and you will have to guess again.
