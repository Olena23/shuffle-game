# shuffle-game
This project is a guessing game where you have to guess two similar cards. Star rating, your time and number of mover are recorded.
A timer starts as soon as you load the game. So don't linger and start clicking!
However, beware to click more than two cards until you get the move result - you will be punished and even if you've guessed two out of three, your move will be spoled and you will have to guess again.

The project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree program and uses pre-defined board styles.
